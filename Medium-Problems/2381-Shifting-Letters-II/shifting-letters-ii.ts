// PROBLEM 2381 - SHIFTING LETTERS II

// You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array shifts where shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]
// For every i, shift the characters in s from the index start[i] to the index end[i] (inclusive)
// --> Forward if direction[i] = 1, or shift the characters backward if direction[i] = 0

// Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a')
// Similarly, shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'a' becomes 'z')

// Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// THOUGHTS

// PREFIX SUM TECHNIQUE
// Similar to problem #2559 -> Calculate all of the shifts possible BEFORE performaing the shifts
// If we shift for each index of the shifts array, it can become a very slow process --> My first solution failed on Leetcode because of this

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

function shiftingLetters(s: string, shifts: number[][]): any {
    // Initialize an array that will keep track of the move direction at each index of s
    // The extra element (s.length + 1) helps us manage the shifts at the end of the range --> So we don't modify the array beyond the last letter (avoids error)
    let moves = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(0);

        // Where the range of the current shift begins --> Set to 1 means it will increase the characters vs. -1 which will reverse
        // If two shifts affect the same index, the net effect (shift) will be the sum of their indvidual directions
        moves[start] += direction === 1 ? 1 : -1;

    // This will help us zero index the letters in the alphabet later on --> 'b'.charCodeAt(0) - base = 1 and 'z'.charCodeAt(0) - base = 25 (zero indexed)
    // This also helps with the wraparound from z to a and a to z

        // We add the 26 to this remainder to ensure that we are always positive between 0 and 25 --> -1 become 25 which is z
        // Because of that addition, we can exceed our valid char range, so again we find the remainder by using modulo 26 which then computes our final answer

        // Then we find the remainder from the alphabet (Which also assists in the wraparound condition) and we add the base of 97 back to find the accurate character code
