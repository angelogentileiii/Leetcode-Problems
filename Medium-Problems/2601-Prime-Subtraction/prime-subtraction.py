# PROBLEM #2601 - PRIME SUBTRACTION OPERATION

# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

# You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

# Pick an index i that you havenâ€™t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
# Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.

# A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Restraints are each num[i] is between 1 and 1000

# THOUGHTS

# A list of prime values up to 1000 - To use for computing the increasing values or not
# Loop through the list and find the maximum prime we can subtract from any number
# Subtract that prime and update the value in the list
# As long as it is greater than the previously updated number, we are good to continue --> Otherwise we found a False condition


def primeSubOperation(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    # List of prime numbers up to upper bound of restraint --> Second solution provides a way to generate dynamically and use bisect_left
